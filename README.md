### Hi there, I'm Andrea 👋

🎓 **Computer Science Student @ Sapienza University of Rome**

I am a software engineer in training with a dual passion: building robust **Artificial Intelligence** systems and exploring the **Theoretical Foundations** of computer science.
My approach combines the practical power of modern Deep Learning with the rigorous elegance of Formal Language Theory.

### 🔭 Current Focus
I am currently working on **NeuroMetric**, a research project for the kinetic analysis of neurological symptoms.
* **Objective:** Upgrading the architecture from LSTM-based models to **Transformers** (Self-Attention mechanisms) to enhance temporal sequence modeling and classification accuracy on biomedical data.

---

### 🔬 Research Interests & Topics
I am deeply interested in the intersection of practical engineering and abstract theory. My main areas of focus include:

* **Artificial Intelligence:** Computer Vision, Deep Learning, Information Theory.
* **Programming Language Theory:** Type Systems, Formal Semantics, Lambda Calculus.
* **Mathematical Foundations & Algebra:** Inductive Data Structures, Peano Axioms & Induction Principles, Inductive Algebras
* **Theory of Computation:** Complexity Classes, Computability.
